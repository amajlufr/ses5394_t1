# Household Vehicle Availability Analysis

This project examines changes in household vehicle availability due to simulated shifts in population and employment within the study area. 
Specifically, it analyzes the impact of removing 176,818 construction workers, representing 0.8% of the total population, who were assumed to be low-income for simplicity. 
The analysis was conducted using the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organizationâ€™s (MPO) regional travel demand model (TDM23), a tool that simulates travel behavior and transportation system performance based on demographic and employment changes.
